2017-06-10  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug #1265765 with patches from Matthias Larisch and Edgar Soldin
      - SSH Paramiko backend now uses BufferedFile implementation to enable
        collecting the entire list of files on the backend.
    * Copy.com is gone so remove copycombackend.py.
    * Merged in lp:~xlucas/duplicity/swift-multibackend-bug
      - Fix a bug when swift backend is used in a multibackend configuration.

2017-06-02  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fix bug #1672540 with patch from Benoit Nadeau
      - Rename would fail to move par files when moving across filesystems.
      - Patch uses shutil.move() to do the rename instead.

2017-05-31  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Revisited bug #670891 with patch from Edgar Soldin
      - Forced librsync.PatchedFile() to extract file object from TemporaryFile()
        object when on Windows or Cygwin systems.  This allows us to avoid the
        problem of tmpfile() use which creates temp files in the wrong place.
      - See discussion at https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/670891

2017-05-17  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * May have finally fixed bug #1556553, "Too many open files...".
      - Applied patch from Howard Kaye, question #631423.  The fix is to dup
        the file descriptor, and then close the file in the deallocator
        routine in the glue code. Duping the file lets the C code and the Python
        code each close the file when they are done with it.
      - Invalidated and removed the fix put in for bug #1320832.
      - Caveat: long incremental chains will still eat up a large number of file
        descriptors.  It's a very risky practice, so I'm not inclined to fix it.

2017-05-11  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug #1320641 and others regarding lockfile
      - swap from lockfile to fasteners module
      - use an fcntl() style lock for process lock of duplicity cache
      - lockfile will now clear if duplicity is killed or crashes

2017-05-09  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug #1689632 with patch from Howard Kaye
      - On MacOS, the tempfile.TemporaryFile call erroneously raises an
        IOError exception saying that too many files are open. This causes
        restores to fail randomly, after thousands of files have been restored.

2017-05-07  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug #1320832 with suggestion from Oskar Wycislak
      - Use chunks instead of reading it all in swiftbackend

2017-04-20  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug #1680682 with patch supplied from Dave Allan

    * Fixed man page that had 'cancel' instead of 'loopback' for pinentry mode
    * Fixed bug #1684312 with suggestion from Wade Rossman
      - Use shutil.copyfile instead of os.system('cp ...')
      - Should reduce overhead of os.system() memory usage.

      - Crash with UnicodeEncodeError
    * Some fixes to gpg.py to handle gpg1 & gpg2 & gpg2.1 commandline issues
      - --gpg-agent is optional on gpg1, but on gpg2 it is used automatically
      - --pinentry-mode is not a valid opt until gpg2.1, so condition on that

2017-02-08  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

      - Sets a user agent. Backblaze asked for this in case there are errors that originate
        from the Duplicity B2 backend
      - Only retrieves a new upload URL when the current one expires, to bring it in line
        with their best practices for integrations: https://www.backblaze.com/b2/docs/integration_checklist.html

2017-01-21  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug #1658283 "Duplicity 0.7.11 broken with GnuPG 2.0"
      - Made gpg version check more robust than just major version
      - Now use --pinentry-mode=loopback on gpg 2.1 and greater
      - Removed check for non-Linux systems, a false problem

2017-01-19  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fix Bug #1642813 with patch from Ravi
      - If stat() returns None, don't attempt to set perms.
    * Merged in lp:~breunigs/duplicity/amazondrive3
      - As reported on the mailinglist, if a space is entered while duplicity asks for the URL, it fails.
        Since all important spaces are URL encoded anyway, this should be fine even if there are spaces in
        the URL at all. I also patched it in the onedrive backend, because it must have similar issues.

2016-12-24  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fix problem with gpg2 in yakety and zesty

2016-12-11  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/Bug_1624725_files_within_folder_slash
      - Fixed Bug #1624725, so that an include glob ending in "/" now includes folder contents (for globs with
        and without special characters). This preserves the behaviour that an expression ending in "/" only
        matches a folder, but now the contents of any matching folder is included.

2016-12-08  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~horgh/duplicity/copy-symlink-targets-721599

    * Merged in lp:~dernils/duplicity/robust-dropbox-backend
      - Added new command line option --backend-retry-delay
        that allows to determine the time that duplicity sleeps
        before retrying after an error has occured.
      - Added some robustness to dpbxbackend.py that ensures re-authentication
        happens in case that a socket is changed (e.g. due to a forced reconnect
        of a dynamic internet connection).
    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/manpage.fixes

      - GPG: enable truly non-interactive operation with gpg2
      - This patch fixes the IMO unexpected behavior that, when using GnuPG2, a pass phrase dialog always pops up for

    * Merged in lp:~harningt/duplicity/multibackend-mirror
      - This changeset addresses multibackend handling to permit a
        mirroring option in addition to its "stripe" mode to make it
        a redundancy tool vs space-expansion tool. To do this without
        changing the configuration too much, I used the query string
        that would generally go unused for files to specify behavior
        that applies to all items inside the configuration file.

      - make sure packages using python's tempfile create temp files in
          duplicity's temp dir

2015-10-31  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Reversed previous changes to lockfile.  Now it will take any version
      extant in the LP build repository.  (PyPi is not avail in LP build).

2015-10-27  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Cleanup issues around Launchpad build, mainly lockfile >= 0.9.
    * Merged in lp:~michal-s/duplicity/duplicity
      - WindowsAzureMissingResourceError and WindowsAzureConflictError
        changed due to SDK changes.

2015-10-26  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Applied patch from Alexander Zangerl to update to changes in lockfile
      API 0.9 and later.  Updated README to notify users.
    * Modded tox.ini to use the latest lockfile.
    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/setup.shebang
      - Having the python interpreter searched in the PATH is much more
        flexible than the /usr/bin/python inserted into our scripts shebang
        by setuptools.  This patch prevents that. don't touch my shebang! :)

2015-10-12  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Upgrade to newest version of pep8 and pylint.   Add three ignores
      to test_pep8 and one to test_pylint to get the rest to pass.  They
      are all valid in our case.

2015-10-10  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mnjul/duplicity/s3-infreq-access
      - This adds support for AWS S3's newly announced Infrequent Access
        storage class and is intended to implement Blueprint:
        https://blueprints.launchpad.net/duplicity/+spec/aws-s3-std-ia-class .
      - A new command line option, --s3-use-ia, is added, and boto backend
        will automatically use the correct storage class value depending on
        whether --s3-use-rrs and --s3-use-ia is set. Command line parser will
        prompt error if both --s3-use-ia and --s3-use-rrs are used together,
        as they conflict with each other.
      - The manpage has been updated giving a short explanation on the new
        option. Its wording derives from Amazon's official announcement:
        https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2015/09/announcing-new-\
        amazon-s3-storage-class-and-lower-glacier-prices/
    * The ptyprocess module no longer supports Python 2.6, so fix tox.ini to
      use an older version.  Make explicit environs for all tests.

    * Merged in lp:~duplicity-team/duplicity/po-updates
    * Prep for 0.7.05

2015-09-14  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~bmerry/duplicity/pydrive-id-cache
      - This fixes the issue a number of users (including myself) have been
        having with duplicity creating files with duplicate filenames on
        Google Drive. It keeps a runtime cache of filename to object ID
        mappings, so that once it has uploaded an object it won't be fooled
        by weakly consistent directory listings.

2015-09-06  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fix bug #1493573.  Correct option name in man page.
    * Fix bug #1494228 CygWin: TypeError: basis_file must be a (true) file
      - The problem that caused the change to tempfile.TemporaryFile was due
        to the fact that os.tmpfile always creates its file in the system
        temp directory, not in the directory specified.  The fix applied was
        to use os.tmpfile in cygwin/windows and tempfile.TemporaryFile in all
        the rest.  This means that cygwin is now broken with respect to temp
        file placement of this one file (deleted automatically on close).

2015-09-06  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Updated man pages to reflect more contributors.

2015-08-25  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~germar/duplicity/par2removefix
      - After reorganisation in revision 981 and the fix for bug #1406173 the
        par2backend does not remove .par2 files anymore when removing
        duplicity-*.gpg files.
      - This banch adds an unfiltered_list() method which is used in
        delete() and delete_list()

2015-08-22  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~w.baranowski/duplicity/selection_debug
      - This little patch logs debug messages concerning path selection process,
        and so allows users to debug their include/exclude configuration.

2015-08-19  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed Bug 1438170 duplicity crashes on resume when using gpg-agent with
      patch from Artur Bodera (abodera).  Applied the same patch to incremental
      resumes as well.

2015-08-04  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed Bug 1476019 S3 storage bucket not being automatically created
      with patch from abeverley
    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/launchpad_tox_profile
      - Add tox testing profile that mimics the packages installed on the
        Launchpad build server, to reduce the likelihood of tests passing
        our test suite, but failing on the build server (e.g. because of
        the out-of-date mock version).
    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/disable_code_tests_for_lpbuildd
      - Set RUN_CODE_TESTS to 0 for lpbuildd tox profile, reflecting its value
        on the Launchpad build server (and therefore skipping PEP8, 2to3 and
        pylint). More accurately reflects the system we are mimicking and saves
        approximately 1 minute per test run.

2015-08-03  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/fix_patch_error
      - Change use of mock.patch in unit tests to accommodate the obsolete
        version of python-mock on the build server.

2015-08-02  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~dag-stenstad/duplicity/swift_authversion_3_support
      - Added support for Openstack Identity v3 in the Swift backend.
    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/fix_2to3_issues
      - Fixed 2to3 issues. Updated README-REPO with more test information. Updated pylint and
        test_diff2 descriptions to make it clear these require packages to be installed on the
        sytem to pass. All tests pass on Python 2.6 and Python 2.7 as at this revision.
    * Prep for 0.7.04

2015-07-31  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/trailing_slash_match_dirs
      - Made globs with trailing slashes only match directories, not files, fixing Bug #1479545.
    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/improve_tox_and_python2-6_testing
      - Testing improvements, particularly in relation to testing against Python version 2.6:
        * tox.ini fixed so that it is possible to run individual tests against both Python 2.6 and 2.7;
        * updated test_code.py to use unittest2 for Python versions < 2.7 (instead of failing);
        * ./run-tests now correctly runs all tests against both Python 2.6 and 2.7; and
        * improved testing directions in README-REPO.

2015-07-29  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/bug_884371
      - Fixed Bug #884371 - Stopped an exclude glob trumping an earlier scan glob, but also
        ensured that an exclude glob is not trumped by a later include. This fix is important,
        as without it files that are specified to be included are not being backed up as expected.
      - Fixed Bug #932482 - a trailing slash at the end of globs no longer prevents them working
        as expected.
    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/reenable_tests
      - Re-enable unit.test_selection tests that had been temporarily commented out.

2015-07-04  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug 1471348 Multi back-end doesn't work with hubiC
      - added init of superclass in both cases.
    * Fixed bug 1471348 Multi back-end doesn't work with hubiC (again)
      - hubiC should reach up to duplicity.backend.__init__

2015-07-03  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/fix_POTFILES.in_and_run-tests
      - Fixed two filename references in po/POTFILES.in, a mistake which crept in in
        rev 1093 and caused testing/run-tests to fail with "IndexError: list index
        out of range".
    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/reactivate_progress_test
      - Re-enable the test of the --progress option (test_exclude_filelist_progress_option),
        which was marked as an expected failure. The issue causing this test to fail was
        fixed in revision 1095 and the test now passes.

2015-06-21  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/gpg.binary
      - new parameter --gpg-binary allows user to point to a different gpg binary,
        not necessarily in path

2015-06-20  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug 1466582 - reduce unnecessary syscall with --exclude-if-present - with
      patch from Kuang-che Wu to make sure resulting path is a directory.

2015-06-17  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug 1466160 - pydrive backend is slow to remove old backup set - with
      patch from Kuang-che Wu to implement _delete_list().

2015-06-16  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug 1465335 - pydrive still use files in trash can - with patch
      from Kuang-che Wu to ignore trashed files.
    * Fixed bug 1452263 - par2 option not working on small processors - with patch
      from Kuang-che Wu to ignore default 30 second timeout.

2015-06-14  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug 791794 - description of --gpg-options is misleading, Simply
      needed to add the '--' before the options as in "--opt1 --opt2=parm".

2015-05-31  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~bmerry/duplicity/pydrive-regular
      - This implements the proposal made by somebody else
        (http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2015-02/msg00037.html)
        to allow the pydrive backend to work with a normal drive account instead
        of a service account. It seems to be working for me: I was able to migrate
        seamlessly from the gdocs backend. It's set up so that a service account
        can still be used, depending on which environment variable is set.
        The man page is updated to describe how to use the new functionality.
    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/gdocs.pydrive
      - make pydrive new gdocs default backend
      - keep gdata backend as gdata+gdocs://
    * Fix a couple of PEP8 glitches.

2015-05-27  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~noizyland/duplicity/fix-progress
      - Fixes bug 1264744.  selection.filelist_globbing_get_sfs leaves the
        filelist file object's position at the end of the file. When the
        --progress option is used the filelists need to be read twice. On
        the second read nothing is read from the file because file has
        already been read and the position is EOF.  This patch calls seek(0)
        on the filelist to reset the position to BOF so that subsequent
        read() calls will return data.
    * Added pylint ignore error in webdavbackend.py.

2015-05-11  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Prep for 0.7.03

2015-05-10  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

        python-requests-oauthlib is not installed (bug 1453355).

2015-05-08  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Added ability to get single file status from collection-status with
      patch from jitao (bug 1044715), like so:
      $ duplicity collection-status --file-changed c1 file://./foo

2015-05-01  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug 1448249 and bug 1449151 thanks to David Coppit.
      - When patching, close base file before renaming

2015-04-20  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merge in lp:~cemsbr/duplicity/duplicity
      - Fix bug 1432229 in Copy.com backend:
        Reply header has no content-type for JSON detection. Now, we also check
        whether the content starts with '{'.
    * Fixed bug 1444404 with patch from Samu Nuutamo
      - rdiffdir patch crashes if a regular file is changed to a non-regular
        file (symlink, fifo, ...)

2015-04-12  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merge in lp:~stynor/duplicity/multi-backend
      - A new backend that allows use of more than one backend stores (e.g. to
        combine the available space from more than one cloud provider to make
        a larger store available to duplicity).
    * Move requirements section lower in manpage.

    * Fix bug 1434702 with help from Robin Nehls
      - incorrect response BackendException while downloading signatures file.

2015-03-18  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fix bug 1432999 with hint from Antoine Afalo.
      - '/'s at end of destination cause problems with onedrivebackend.

2015-03-13  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/filelist_combine
      - Merged globbing and non-globbing filelists to use the same code path
        and all accept globbing characters. Added deprecation warning to the
        --exclude-globbing-filelist and include-globbing-filelist options in
        commandline.py and hid them from help output. Updated the manual
        (and unit tests) accordingly.
      - Note that this does trigger a change in behaviour for duplicity.
        Previously, include patterns in include-filelist did not match files
        in a directory that was included, so /usr/local in an include file
        would not have matched /usr/local/doc. Now, this folder would be
        included, as would occur if --include or the old
        --include-globbing-filelist was used. Additional lines will therefore
        need to be added to filelists to unambiguously exclude unwanted
        subfolders, if this is intended.
      - Mark --include-filelist-stdin and --exclude-fielist-stdin for
        deprecation and hide from --help output.

    * Fix for bug where scp was actually working as scp and not working with
      rsync.net because of using extraneous test command in restricted shell.
      Was trying "test -d 'foo' || mkdir -p 'foo'", now only "mkdir -p foo".

    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/bug_932482_trailing_slashes_and_wildcards_error
      - Added functional and unit tests to show Bug #932482 - that selection does
        not work correctly when excludes (in a filelist or in a commandline option)
        contain both a single or double asterisk and a trailing slash.
    * Misc fixes for the following PEP8 issues:
      - E231, E241, E251, E261, E262, E271, E272, E301, E302, E303, E502,
        E701, E702, E703, E711, E721, W291, W292, W293, W391

    * Ongoing pep8 corrections.
    * Merged in lp:~angusgr/duplicity/exclude-older-than
      - Add "--exclude-older-than" commandline option, that allows you to only
        back up files with a modification date newer than a particular threshold.
    * Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/bug_884371_asterisks_in_includes
      - Added tests to unit/test_selection.py and funtional/test_selection.py
        to show the behaviour reported in Bug #884371, i.e. that selection is
        incorrect when there is a * or ** on an include line of a filelist or
        commandline --include.

2015-01-22  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug # 1414418
      - Aligned commandline.py options and help display contents.

      consistent with commandline option naming conventions.
    * Applied patch from Adam Reichold to fix bug # 1413792.

2015-01-22  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

2015-01-13  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~noizyland/duplicity/fix_azurebackend_container_names
      - Azure Backend examples have underscores in the container names.  These
        are not valid Azure container names.  The underscores have been replaced
        with hypens and a note about valid container names added to the man page.
      - Also corrects a problem where Azure Exceptions were returing unicode
        strings that were not being handled correctly.
    * Merged in lp:~user3942934/duplicity/pydrive
      - Currently duplicity uses gdocs backend for Google Drive backups.
        gdocs uses deprecated API and don't allow backups for managed Google
        accounts.  (see https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1315684)
      - Added pydrive backend that solves both of those problems. Published
        also on https://github.com/westerngateguard/duplicity-pydrive-backend.
    * Fixed some tabs/spaces problems that were causing install failures.

2015-01-13  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

* Merged in lp:~aaron-whitehouse/duplicity/progress_option_error
  - Added test_exclude_globbing_filelist_progress_option into
    functional/test_selection.py, which shows the error reported in
    Bug #1264744 - that the --exclude-globbing-filelist does not backup
    the correct files if the --progress option is used. Test is marked as
    an expected failure so as not to cause the test suite to fail.

2015-01-12  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed some recently added 2to3 and pep8 issues.
    * Merged in lp:~vincegt/duplicity/swift_regionname
      - Fixes bug #1376628
      - Add mapping of SWIFT_REGIONNAME to select region inside SWIFT when a
        provider proposes more than one region.

2015-01-11  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~9-sa/duplicity/FixBug1408289
      - Fix bug #1408289
      - Wrong attribute name prevented raise of client exception, working now
    * Merged in lp:~noizyland/duplicity/azurebackend
      - Add backend for Azure Blob Storage Service
    * Prep for 0.7.01

2015-01-08  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~stapelberg+ubuntu/duplicity/add-onedrive-backend
      - Add a Microsoft OneDrive backend
    * Merged in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/filelist_select_bug_1408411
      - Adds functional test cases that fail because of Bug #1408411 (commented
        out), to assist in fixing that bug.
    * Merged in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/process_filelists_for_spaces_etc
      - Process filelists to remove imperfections such as blank lines, comments
        and leading/trailing whitespace. Also correctly processes quoted folders
        containing spaces in their names. Extensive unit and functional tests to
        test these changes (and selection more generally).
      - The branch does add an additional folder to testfiles.tar.gz called
        select2. This included a folder with a trailing space, to test the quote
        test. The subfolders also have clearer names than in the "select" folder
        (eg "1sub2sub3") which makes it easier to keep track of issues in tests.

2015-01-01  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Misc fixes for the following PEP8 issues:
       - E211, E221, E222, E225, E226, E228
       - see http://pep8.readthedocs.org
    * Fixed bug 1278529 by applying patch supplied in report
      - Use get_bucket() rather than lookup() on S3 to get proper error msg.

2014-12-29  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed bug 1406173 by applying patch supplied in report
      - Ignore .par2 files in remote file list
    * Removed redundant shell test testing/verify_test.sh

2014-12-28  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/add-additional-verify-tests-for-corrupted-archives
      - Add tests to test_verify.py to test that verify fails if the archive
        file is corrupted. Changed file objects to use the with keyword to ensure
        that the file is properly closed.
      - Small edit to find statement in verify_test.sh to make it work as
        expected (enclose string in quotes).
    * Merged in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/add-else-to-badupload-try-except
      - Badupload test previously did not have an else in the try-except. The
        test passed if the except was triggered, but would also pass if the
        test did not trigger an error at all.

2014-12-18  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merge in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/test-verify-improvements
      - Fix up test_verify, which was a bit of a mess:
      - Simplify test_verify.py to just do a simple backup and verify on a
        single file in each test.
      - Modify tests to correctly use --compare-data option.
      - Add tests for when the source files have atime/mtime manipulated.
    * Fix duplicity verify to ignore the file system when globals.compare_data is
      False.  This means that verify only validates the viability of the backup
      itself unless --compare-data is specified.
    * Reenable test_verify_changed_source_file test

2014-12-17  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merge in lp:~hooloovoo/duplicity/verify-not-check-source

      - move netloc usage definitions into respective backends
      - fix "[Question #259173]: rsync backend fails"
        https://answers.launchpad.net/duplicity/+question/259173
    * Make ssh an unsupported backend scheme

      conditioned on protocol ftp or ftps.

2014-11-20  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Undid move of testing/test_code.py.  Instead I fixed it
      so that it would not run during PPA build.  It now needs
      the setting RUN_CODE_TESTS=1 in the environment which is
      supplied in the tox.ini file.

2014-11-19  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Remove valid_extension() check from file_naming.py.  It was
      causing failed tests for short filenames.  Thanks edso.
    * Moved testing/test_code.py to testing/manual/code_test.py
      so PPA builds would succeed.  Should be moved back later.

    * Fixed bug 1375304 with patch supplied by Aleksandar Ivanovic

2014-08-17  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Added sxbacked.py, Skylable backend.  Waiting on man page updates.
    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/manpage.verify
      - Clarify verify's functionality as wished for by a user surprised with a big
        bandwidth bill from rackspace.
    * Merged in lp:~jeffreydavidrogers/duplicity/duplicity
      - This change fixes two small typos in the duplicity man page.

2014-06-28  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~3v1n0/duplicity/copy.com-backend
      - I've added a backend for Copy.com cloud storage, this supports all the
        required operations and works as it should from my tests.
      - You can use it by calling duplicity with something like:
        copy://account@email.com:your-password@copy.com/duplicity
      - The only thing I've concerns with is the optimized support for _delete_list
        which can't be enabled here because the test_delete_list tries also to
        delete a not-existing files, and it requires the backend not to raise an
        exception in that case (is this somewhat wanted or could we do the same as
        for _delete or _query?)
    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav200fix-0.7
      - webdav backend fix "BackendException: Bad status code 200 reason OK. " when
        restarting an interrupted backup and overwriting partially uploaded volumes.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/webdav-fixes
      - This branch fixes two issues I saw when testing the webdav backend:
      - 1) Errors like the following: "Attempt 1 failed. BackendException: File
        /tmp/duplicity-LQ1a0i-tempdir/mktemp-u2aiyX-2 not found locally after get
        from backend".  These were caused by the _get() method not calling setdata()
        on the local path object, so the rest of the code thought it didn't exist.
      - 2) Some odd issues from stale responses/data. We have a couple places in
        webdavbackend.py where we close the connection before making a request
        because of this problem. But I've changed it to do it every time, more
        reliably, by putting a _close() call inside the request() method.
      - With this, the webdav backend seems fine to me.
    * Merged in lp:~antmak/duplicity/0.7-par2-fix
      - Useful fix for verbatim par2cmdline options (like "-t" in par2-tbb version)
    * Fixed bug 1327550: OverflowError: signed integer is greater than maximum
      - Major and minor device numbers are supposed to be one byte each.  Someone
        has crafted a special system image using OpenVZ where the major and minor
        device numbers are much larger (ploop devices).  We treat them as (0,0).

2014-05-11  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py2.6.0
      - Support python 2.6.0.
      - Without this branch, we only support python >= 2.6.5 because that's when
        python's urlparse.py module became its more modern incarnation. (I won't
        get into the wisdom of them making such a change in the middle of the
        2.6 lifecycle.)
      - Also, the version of lockfile that I have (0.8) doesn't work with python
        2.6.0 or 2.6.1 due to their implementation of
        threading.current_thread().ident returning None unexpectedly. So this
        branch tells lockfile not to worry about adding the current thread's
        identifier to the lock filename (we don't need a separate lock per thread,
        since our locking is per process).
      - I've tested with 2.6.0 and 2.7.6 (both extremes of our current support).
    * Update shebang line to python2 instead of python to avoid confusion.

2014-04-30  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encode-exceptions
      - Because exceptions often contain file paths, they have the same problem
        with Python 2.x's implicit decoding using the 'ascii' encoding that we've
        experienced before.  So I added a new util.uexc() method that uses the
        util.ufn() method to convert an exception to a unicode string and used it
        around the place.
      - Bugs fixed: 1289288, 1311176, 1313966

2014-04-29  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/backend-unification
      - Reorganize and simplify backend code.  Specifically:
        - Formalize the expected API between backends and duplicity.  See the new
          file duplicity/backends/README for the instructions I've given authors.
        - Add some tests for our backend wrapper class as well as some tests for
          individual backends.  For several backends that have some commands do all
          the heavy lifting (hsi, tahoe, ftp), I've added fake little mock commands
          so that we can test them locally.  This doesn't truly test our integration
          with those commands, but at least lets us test the backend glue code.
        - Removed a lot of duplicate and unused code which backends were using (or
          not using).  This branch drops 700 lines of code (~20%)
          in duplicity/backends!
        - Simplified expectations of backends.  Our wrapper code now does all the
          retrying, and all the exception handling.  Backends can 'fire and forget'
          trusting our wrappers to give the user a reasonable error message.
          Obviously, backends can also add more details and make nicer error
          messages.  But they don't *have* to.
        - Separate out the backend classes from our wrapper class.  Now there is no
          possibility of namespace collision.  All our API methods use one
          underscore.  Anything else (zero or two underscores) are for the backend
          class's use.
        - Added the concept of a 'backend prefix' which is used by par2 and gio
          backends to provide generic support for "schema+" in urls -- like par2+
          or gio+.  I've since marked the '--gio' flag as deprecated, in favor of
          'gio+'.  Now you can even nest such backends like
          par2+gio+file://blah/blah.
        - The switch to control which cloudfiles backend had a typo.  I fixed this,
          but I'm not sure I should have?  If we haven't had complaints, maybe we
          can just drop the old backend.
        - I manually tested all the backends we have (except hsi and tahoe -- but
          those are simple wrappers around commands and I did test those via mocks
          per above).  I also added a bunch more manual backend tests to
          ./testing/manual/backendtest.py, which can now be run like the above to
          test all the files you have configured in config.py or you can pass it a
          URL which it will use for testing (useful for backend authors).

2014-04-26  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py3-map-filter
      - In py3, map and filter return iterable objects, not lists. So in each case
        we use them, I've either imported the future version or switched to a list
        comprehension if we really wanted a list.

2014-04-25  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

2014-04-20  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/more-test-reorg
      - Here's another test reorganization / modernization branch. It does the
        following things:
        - Drop duplicity/misc.py. It is confusing to have both misc.py and util.py,
          and most of the code in misc.py was no longer used. I moved the one
          function that was still used into util.py.
        - Consolidated the various ways to run tests into just one. I made tox runs
          go through ./setup.py test, rather than nosetests. And I made the
          ./testing/run-tests scripts just call tox. Now we no longer need nosetests
          as a test dependency (although you can still use it if you want).
        - Added two more code quality automated tests: a pep8 one and a pylint one.
          I disabled almost all checks in each program that gave a warning. These
          tests just establish a baseline for future improvement.
        - Moved the test helper code into TestCase subclasses that all tests can
          use. And used more code sharing and setUp/tearDown cleverness to remove
          duplicated code.
        - Reorganized the tests in ./testing/tests into ./testing/functional and
          ./testing/unit -- for whether they drive duplicity as a subprocess or
          whether they import and test code directly. Each dir can have specialized
          TestCase subclasses now.
        - Renamed the files in ./testing/unit to more clearly indicate which file
          in ./duplicity they are unit testing.
        - Added some helper methods for tests to set environment and globals.*
          parameters more safely (i.e. without affecting other tests) by
          automatically cleaning up any such changes during test tearDown.
        - Removed test_unicode.py, since it is kind of dumb. It used to be more
          useful, but now with py2.6, we are just testing that one line of code
          in it is actually there.

2014-04-19  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/2.6isms
      - Here's a whole stack of minor syntax modernizations that will become
        necessary in python3. They all work in python2.6.
      - I've added a new test to keep us honest and prevent backsliding on these
        modernizations. It runs 2to3 and will fail the test if 2to3 finds anything
        that needs fixing (with a specific set of exceptions carved out).
      - This branch has most of the easy 2to3 fixes, the ones with obvious and
        safe syntax changes.
      - We could just let 2to3 do them for us, but ideally we use 2to3 as little
        as possible, since it doesn't always know how to solve a given problem.
        I will propose a branch later that actually does use 2to3 to generate
        python3 versions of duplicity if they are requested. But this is a first
        step to clean up the code base.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-static
      - Drop static.py.
      - This is some of the oldest code in duplicity! A bzr blame says it is
        unmodified (except for whitespace / comment changes) since revision 1.
      - But it's not needed anymore. Not really even since we updated to python2.4,
        which introduced the @staticmethod decorator. So this branch drops it and
        its test file.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encode-for-print
      - Encode translated strings before passing them to 'print'.
      - The print command can only apparently handle bytes. So when we pass it
        unicode, it freaks out. There were only four instances I saw where we used
        print, so I figured it was easiest to just convert them to use the log
        framework too.
      - That way all user-visible strings go through that framework and are subject
        to the same encoding rules.

2014-04-17  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~fredrik-loch/duplicity/duplicity-S3-SSE
      - Adds support for server side encryption as requested in Bug #996660
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/consolidate-tests
      - Consolidate all the duplicity-running code in the test framework.
      - This takes the four test files [1] that run duplicity itself (i.e. the
        high-level functional test files) and consolidates their code. Before, it
        was madness. Each one had its own run_duplicity method, with its own
        slightly tweaked features. This should reduce a lot of duplication.
      - [1] cleanuptest.py, finaltest.py, restarttest.py, and badupload.py
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/modern-testing
      - Enable/use more modern testing tools like nosetests and tox as well as more
        common setup.py hooks like test and sdist.
      - Specifically:
        * move setup.py to toplevel where most tools and users expect it
        * Move and adjust test files to work when running "nosetests" in toplevel
          directory. Specifically, do a lot more of the test setup in
          tests/__init__.py rather than the run-tests scripts
        * Add small tox.ini file for using tox, which is a wrapper for using
          virtualenv. Only enable for py26 and py27 right now, since modern
          setuptools dropped support for <2.6 (and tox 1.7 recently dropped <2.6)
        * Add setup.py hooks for test and sdist which are both standard targets
          (sdist just outsources to dist/makedist right now)
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/require-2.6
      - Require at least Python 2.6.
      - Our code base already requires 2.6, because 2.6-isms have crept in. Usually
        because we or a contributor didn't think to test with 2.4. And frankly,
        I'm not even sure how to test with 2.4 on a modern system.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-u1
      - Ubuntu One is closing shop. So no need to support a u1 backend anymore.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/fix-drop-u1
      - Looks like when the drop-u1 branch got merged, its conflict got resolved
        badly. Here is the right version of backend.py to use (and also drops
        u1backend.py from POTFILES).
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/drop-pexpect
      - Drop our local copy of pexpect in favor of a system version.
      - It's only used by the pexpect ssh backend (and if you're opting into that,
        you probably can expect that you will need pexpect) and the tests.
      - I've done a quick smoketest (backed up and restored using
        --ssh-backend=pexpect) and it seemed to work fine with a modern version
        of pexpect.

     * Merged in lp:~germer/duplicity/par2
      - This branch adds Par2 recovery files to duplicity. It is a wrapper backend
        which will create the recovery files and upload them all together with the
        wrapped backend. Corrupt archives will be detected and repaired (if
        possible) on the fly during restore.
      - It can be used with url-string par2+webdavs://USER@HOST/PATH
      - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/426282

2014-03-06  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/fix.dpbx
      - Fix dpbx backend "NameError: global name 'rest' is not defined"
    * Merged in lp:~prateek/duplicity/botoimportfix
      - Switches the boto backend back to using lazy imports so there are no
        complaints during the importing of backends.

2014-02-26  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~prateek/duplicity/s3-glacier
      - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1039511
        - Adds support to detect when a file is on Glacier and initiates a restore
          to S3. Also merges overlapping code in the boto backends
      - Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1243246
        - Adds a --s3_multipart_max_timeout input option to limit the max execution
          time of a chunked upload to S3. Also adds debug message to calculate
          upload speed.

2014-02-24  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pexpect-fix
      - duplicity has its own copy of pexpect. Use that instead of requiring one
        from the system.

2014-02-05  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/gpg-encode
      - getpass.getpass(prompt) eventually calls str(prompt). Which is a no go,
        if the prompt contains unicode. Here's a patch to always pass getpass() a
        byte string.
      - Our tests didn't catch this because they always set PASSPHRASE. I've added
        a test that passes the passphrase via stdin.

2014-01-31  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Applied two patches from mailing list message at:

      "Added command line options to use different prefixes for manifest/sig/archive files"
      This resolves https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1170161 and provides

    * Merged in lp:~louis-bouchard/duplicity/add-allow-concurrency
      - Implement locking mechanism to avoid concurrent execution under the same
        cache directory. This is the default behavior.
      - Also implement --alllow-concurrency option to disable the locking
        if required.
      - This functionality adds a dependency to python-lockfile

2014-01-13  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Restored patch of gdocsbackend.py from original author (thanks ede)
    * Applied patch from bug 1266753: Boto backend removes local cache if

2014-01-02  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Restored missing line from patch of gdocsbackend.py
    * Reverted changes to gdocsbackend.py

2013-12-30  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/encoding
      - This branch hopefully fixes two filename encoding issues:
      - Users in bug 989496 were noticing a UnicodeEncodeError exception which
        happens (as far as I can tell) because some backends (like webdav) are
        returning unicode filenames from list(). When these filenames are combined
        with the utf8 translations of log messages, either (A) the default ascii
        encoding can't handle promoting the utf8 bytes or -- if there aren't any
        utf8 bytes in the translation -- (B) the resulting unicode string raises
        an error later when log.py tries to upgrade the string again to unicode
        for printing.
      - This fix is largely implemented by adding a wrapper for backend list()
        implementations. This wrapper ensures that duplicity internals always see
        a byte string. (I'd like to eventually use this same wrapping strategy to
        implement generic retry support without backends having to add any logic,
        but that's just a thought for the future.)
      - That is, the fix for issue #1 is completely inside backend.py and the
        changes to backends/*.py.
      - The rest of the invasive changes deal with filenames that may not be valid
        utf8. This is much rarer, but possible. For proper handling of this, we
        need to print using unicode, and convert filenames from the system filename
        encoding to unicode, gracefully handling conversion errors. Some of the
        filenames we print are remote names. Who knows what encoding they are in;
        it could be different than the system filename encoding. 99% of the time,
        everything will be utf8 and we're fine. If we do get conversion errors,
        the only effect should be some question mark characters in duplicity
        logging output.
      - I tried to convert as much of the actual codebase to use unicode for
        printing. But I stopped short of adding an assert in log.py to enforce
        unicode, because I didn't want to go through all the backend code and
        manually adjust those bits without being able to test each one.

2013-12-28  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~jkrauss/duplicity/pyrax
      - Rackspace has deprecated python-cloudfiles in favor of their pyrax
        library, which consolidates all Rackspace Cloud API functionality into
        a single library.  Tested it with Duplicity 0.6.21 on both Arch Linux
        and FreeBSD 8.3.0.
    * Changed to default to pyrax backend rather than cloudfiles backend.
      To revert to the cloudfiles backend use '--cf-backend=cloudfiles'

2013-11-17  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~verb/duplicity/bucket_root_fix
      - Fix bug that prevents backing up to the root of a bucket with boto backend.
    * Merged in lp:~gliptak/duplicity/415619
      - Better error message when chown fails
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/log-path-type
      - Any backup browser built on top of duplicity will need to indicate which
        files in the backup are folders and which are files. The current logging
        information doesn't provide this detail. So I've added a field to the
        log.InfoCode.file_list output that includes the path type.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/manifest-oddities
      - We may accidentally end up with an oddly inconsistent manifest like so:
        Volume 1
        Volume 2
        Volume 3
        Volume 2
        As did get reported recently on the mailing list:
        http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2013-11/msg00009.html
      - One way this can happen (the only way?) is if you back up, then duplicity
        gets interrupted between writing the manifest and uploading the volume.
        Then, when restarted, there is no longer enough data to create as many
        volumes as existed previously.
      - This situation can cause an exception when trying to restart the backup.
      - This branch fixes it by deleting any excess volume information encountered
        when loading in the manifest. We discard volume with higher numbers
        than the last one read.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/disappearing-source
      - When restarting a backup, we may accidentally skip the first chunk of one of
        the source files. To reproduce this,:
        1) interrupt a backup
        2) delete the source file it was in the middle of
        3) restart the backup
      - When replaying the source iterator to find where to resume from, we can't
        notice that the file is gone until we've already iterated past where it
        would be!
      - The solution I came up with is to just let duplicity stuff the data we
        accidentally read back into the source iterator.
      - This is actually a data loss bug, because it's possible to back up
        corrupted files (that are missing their first chunk).
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/normalize-before-using
      - Avoid throwing an exception due to a None element in a patch sequence.
      - None elements in a (non-normalized) patch sequence are perfectly normal.
        With the current code in the patched function, it is certainly possible to
        hit a crash due a None.
        See http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/duplicity-talk/2013-11/msg00005.html
      - This branch fixes that by normalizing the sequence before using it in the
        logging code. It's acceptable to bring the normalize_ps() call outside the
        try/except block because normalize_ps is not expected to throw. It's
        relatively simple and doesn't really use its objects besides checking if
        they are None.

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/catch-seq-copy-error
      - Any* exception when running patch_seq2ropath should be ignored (though
        logged) and duplicity should move on. This covers the two asserts in that
        function (bug 1155345 and bug 720525) as well as errors that happen during
        file copying (bug 662442).

    * Merged in lp:~verb/duplicity/boto-gcs
      - These patches add support for Google Cloud Storage via the boto backend.

2013-04-27  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~tblue/duplicity/paramiko-1.10.0
      - This fixes bug #1156746, making the Paramiko backend compatible with
        Paramiko 1.10.0. It keeps compatibility with older Paramiko versions.
    * Merged in lp:~townsend/duplicity/fix-1161599-2
      - The fix in revno. 912 didn't take into account that the parameter "body"
        passed into request() is overloaded, so when it was NULL or of a type other
        than file, it would fail.  This checks if "body" is of type "file" before
        actually seek()'ing back to the beginning of the file.
    * Merged in lp:~tblue/duplicity/paramiko-fix-delete-retry
      - This fixes bug #1115715, which is really annoying. Basically it makes
        using the Paramiko backend with the default settings impossible.
    * Merged in lp:~juan-f/duplicity/progress
      - From time ago, there are people asking for a progress bar estimation in duplicity.
        There is even a script that circumvents the issue, getting info from the log so as
        to estimate the progress status ( https://github.com/quentin/Duplicity-progress )
        but does not give enough feedback and the estimation is rather plain.
      - I have developed a set of heuristics that gather information from the deltas and
        the transfer ratios of the backend so as to forecast % of progress, estimation of
        remaining time and average speed, for both full and incremental backup uploads.
      - The current implementation works for boto backend, but to port the other backends
        to use this feature would be quite easy (we can discuss the details if interested).
      - The algorithm is activated by the --progress command line flag, and will perform a
        first-pass dry-run to collect evidence for all the deltas. Next it will trigger the
        real upload, while a thread statistically estimates the ratio of changes and
        compression for the data in/out, and uses these ratios to forecast time remaining
        and % of completion.
      - The progress data will be logged each 3 seconds, or the --progress-rate flag.
    * Merged in lp:~jnoster/duplicity/dpbx-added
      - The application key was approved as "production" one after some changes to the code
        to suit the requirements of Dropbox team (the keys are now obfuscated, for instance).
    * Applied blocksize.patch from https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/897423
      - New option --max-blocksize (default 2048) to allow increasing delta blocksize.
    * Applied duplicity-ftps.patch from https://bugs.launchpad.net/duplicity/+bug/1104069
      - Don't try to delete an empty file list.

2013-02-17  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Applied patches from Laszlo Ersek to rdiffdir to "consume a chain of sigtar
      files in rdiffdir delta mode" which supports incremental sigtar files.
    * Merged in lp:~jnoster/duplicity/dpbx-added
      - Add Dropbox backend
      - NB! In order to use the backend one must:
        1. Install Dropbox Python SDK first.
        2. Run the duplicity with Dropbox backend (dpbx://) first time
           *interactively* to catch and follow the oAuth URL.
    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/verify.data
      - add switch --compare-data, to selectively enable formerly always disabled
        data comparison on verify runs

2013-01-18  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.fix-retry
      - added ssl certificate verification (see man page)
      - more robust retry routine to survive ssl errors, broken pipe errors
      - added http redirect support
    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.manpage
      - explanation of webdav changes above
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/pygi
      - Python bindings for the gobject stack (used in the gio backend) have changed
        from static to dynamically-generated bindings. The old static bindings are
        deprecated. So here's a branch to change the gio backend from old to new ones.
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/py3rsync
      - This branch lets one build the _librsync module with Python 3. You can't
        really do anything useful with it, but it's a nicely-isolated piece to add
        Python 3 support for.
      - The changes are a mix of modernization and #ifdef logic.
      - All tests still pass in Python 2.7 and 2.4. I tested manually that the module
        worked as expected in Python 3.

2013-01-07  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/static-corruption
      - This branch fixes three possible ways a backup could get data-corrupted.
        Inspired by bug 1091269.
          A) If resuming after a volume that ended in a one-block file, we would
             skip the first block of the next file.
          B) If resuming after a volume that ended in a multi-block file, we would
             skip the first block of the next file.
          C) If resuming after a volume that spanned a multi-block file, we would
             skip some data inside the file.
      - A and B are because when finding the right place in the source files to
        restart the backup, the iteration loop didn't handle None block numbers
        very well (which are used to indicate the end of a file).
      - C is what bug 1091269 talks about. This was because data block sizes would
        get smaller as the difftar file got closer and closer to the volsize.
        Standard block sizes were 64 * 1024.  But say we were close to the end of
        the difftar... When resuming, duplicity doesn't know the custom block sizes
        used by the previous run, so it uses standard block sizes. And it doesn't
        always match up, as you can imagine. So we would leave chunks of data out
        of the backed up file.
      - Tests added for these cases.
      - This branch is called 'static-corruption' because all these issues occur
        even when the source data doesn't change. I still think there are some
        corruption issues when a file changes in between duplicity runs. I haven't
        started looking into that yet, but that's next on my list.
      - C only happened without encryption (because the gpg writer function already
        happened to force a constant data block size). A and B happened with or
        without encryption.

2013-01-02  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Fixed 1091269 Data corruption when resuming with --no-encryption
      - Patches from Pascual Abellan that make block size consistent and
        that add no-encryption option to manual-ctrl-c-test.sh.
      - Modified gpg.py patch to use 64k block size so unit test passes.

2013-01-01  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/u1_and_manpage
      - Manpage

      - U1backend
        - lazily import non standard python libs, fixes
        http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.backup.duplicity.general/5753
        - fix "not bytearray" prevents PUT with python 2.6
        - don't hang after putting in credentials (cause it silently retries in background)
          but go through with backup

2012-12-22  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/webdav.fix-retry
      - bugfix: webdav retrying broke on ERRORS like "error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe" in
        socket.pyas reported here https://answers.launchpad.net/duplicity/+question/212966
        added a more generalized 'retry_fatal' decorator which makes retrying backend
        methods even easier
    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/manpage
      - Clear up PASSPHRASE reusage as sign passphrase.  Minor fixes.

2012-12-17  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

      - Generate encrypted backups without revealing the user's key id
        via option --hidden-encrypt-key
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-utf8
      - Make sure u1backend returns filenames as utf8
    * Merged in lp:~carlos-abalde/duplicity/gdocs-backend-gdata-2.0.16.-upgrade
      - Upgrade of GoogleDocs backend to python gdata lib >= 2.0.15:
        Stop using get_everything method.

2012-11-19  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/lftp.netrc
      - Allow .netrc auth for lftp backend
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/946988
      - This fixes bug 946988 by not duplicating the checks for when we should ask
        for the password (those same checks are done more correctly inside
        get_passphrase). And add a test to reproduce the bug.

2012-11-10  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~satwell/duplicity/caching
      - Add a cache for password and group lookups. This significantly improves
        runtime with very large password and group configurations.
    * Merged in lp:~ed.so/duplicity/manpage
      - more formatting fixes, clarifications in sections EXAMPLES, FILE SELECTION

2012-11-03  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/u1-oauthlib
      - As the Ubuntu packager for duplicity, I would prefer u1backend.py
        used oauthlib instead of oauth.  oauthlib is well maintained upstream
        (unlike oauth), has a python3 port (for the future), and is in Ubuntu
        main (so is oauth right now, but hopefully in the future we can drop
        it to universe, in which case duplicity can't use it anymore).
    * Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/delete-new-sig-in-cache
      - In duplicity 0.6.20, we fixed bug 1031269. This means that we no longer
        leave sig files on the remote location.  Leaving sig files on the remote
        location also caused a bug with deleting cache files. Code used to leave
        remote new-sig but delete the locale cache new-sig; this meant that we would
        keep downloadoing the new-sig all the time from remote. We had worked around
        that by just not deleting the new-sig in the cache, which was sort of the
        wrong side of that problem to tackle.  Now that we handle the remote
        new-sigs better (by deleting them), I don't think we need this code anymore.
        Patch by az@debian.org.

    - Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/ropath.index
    + This branch does two main things:
    1) Skips base dir entries when compiling the list of deleted delta iters.
    (this gracefully recovers from the sort of situations that lead to bug
    929067). I'm reasonably confident this is an uninvasive change, but
    please confirm.
    2) Overwrites the sigtar file on backup-restart. This is because AFAICT,
    duplicity will rewrite the entire sigtar each restart. But we were
    opening the sigtar file as "ab", so we'd just dump the contents on top
    of the previous contents. Which was causing some confusion in bug 929067.
    If I'm wrong that we don't always rewrite the entire sigtar each time,
    this needs some rethink. Please also confirm that.
    + In addition, I added two tests for the above two changes and make some
    improvements elsewhere in the restarttest.py file while I was at it.

2012-09-28  Michael Terry  <michael.terry@canonical.com>

    - Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/leftover-sigtar
    + So currently, duplicity does not delete signature files when doing a remove-all-but-n operation. Seems wrong, since those signature files are now useless and take up space.
    + This branch does several things:
    1) Make remove-all-but-n operate on chains. In practice it did before, since the sets it operated on always came from complete chains (i.e. it never used only some of the sets from a chain)
    2) Add a new method to get all signature chains before a certain time.
    3) Use this new method to also delete signature chains during remove-all-but operations.
    + And it cleans up the cleanuptest.py file:
    1) Removes crufty, unused code
    2) Disallows changing the destination folder for the test, which no one would ever want to do and isn't really supported anyway
    3) Add some additional checks to the existing test
    4) Adds two new methods to test remove-all-but-n and remove-all-inc-of-but-n-full

    Merged in lp:~mterry/duplicity/testfixes

    Here are two changes that help the test suite pass (it got broken after the recent round of merges).

    1) When file_naming is asked for a name, don't assert if compression AND encryption are turned on.  They are by default now.  But globals.compression is only meant to take effect if encryption is turned off.  So when encryption is on, just turn off gzip suffixes.

    2) Some tests are unit tests that directly import the relevant duplicity code.  So make sure that regular expressions are setup lazily as needed, not once at the start of bin/duplicity.

2011-06-17  Lekensteyn  <lekensteyn@gmail.com>

    - duplicity.1: move information about the PASSPHRASE and SIGN_PASSPHRASE
    environment variables to the Environment Variables section
    - duplicity.1: add information about the limitation on using
    symmetric+sign to the bugs section
    - In the passphrase retrieval function get_passphrase, do not switch from
    "ask password without verifying" to ask+verify if the passphrase was
    empty
    - Allow an empty passphrase for signing key
    - Make clear in the verification prompt whether the encryption passphrase
    or the signing passphrase is being confirmed
    - Fix passphrase retrieval for sym+sign (duplicity-bin and gpg.py)
    - Allow sym+sign with limitation (see comments and manual page)

2011-06-11  Lekensteyn  <lekensteyn@gmail.com>

    - invalid function description fixed for get_passphrase in duplicity-bin
    - function get_passphrase in duplicity-bin accepts argument "for_signing"
    which indicates that a passphrase for a signing key is requested
    - introduces the SIGN_PASSPHRASE environment variable for passing a
    different passphrase to the signing key
    - commandline option --encrypt-secret-keyring=path introduced to set a
    custom location for the secret keyring used by the encryption key
    - manual page updated with SIGN_PASSPHRASE and --encrypt-secret-keyring
    - ask for a new passphrase if the passphrase confirmation failed to
    prevent an endless retype
    - improved some comments in the code
    - due to the difference in the handling of the signing and encryption
    passphrase, the passphrase is asked later in the duplicity-bin

    merge of lp:~scode/duplicity/ignore-errors

2009-07-04  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

    * support an --ignore-errors command which is intended to mean "try to continue in the face of" errors
    that might possibly be okay to ignore
    - intended during restoration to avoid bailing out on errors that are not fatal yet would in fact
    produce an "incorrect" restoration
    - for now, only changes behavior on file meta data restoration where I happened to have a problem
    (I had a +t file which was impossible to restore to +t even though it was possible for it to
    exist and for me to read it)
    - be clear in the man page that this is only supposed to be used in case of problems and even then
    to please contact maintainer if use is needed

    Changes for 0.6.01.

2009-07-01  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    Fixed issues in Checkpoint/Restart:
    * The --name backupname" option was added to allow the
    user to separate one archive from another.  If not
    specified, the default is an MD5 hash of the target
    URL, which should suffice for most uses.

    * The archive_dir (cache) is now stored in a standard
    location, defaulting to ~/.cache/duplicity.  See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/

    * The interaction between the --archive-dir option and
    the --name option allows for four possible results
    for the location of the archive dir.
    - neither specified (default)
    ~/.cache/duplicity/hash-of-url
    - --archive-dir=~/arch, no --name
    ~/arch/hash-of-url
    - no --archive-dir, --name=foo
    ~/.cache/duplicity/foo
    - --archive-dir=~/arch, --name=foo
    ~/arch/foo

    * duplicity will now copy needed metadata from the
    remote store to the local cache as needed.  This
    means that the first use after upgraded from 0.5.x
    will have the metadata copied to the local archive
    dir in order to sync both.

    * cleanup will now work correctly with the archive
    dir and separates the local from the remote files.

2009-06-27  Kenneth Loafman  <kenneth@loafman.com>

    Fixes bug 392905.  Allow omission of remote file name if the same as the source file name.

2009-06-22  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

    the has of remaining args
    * outstanding issue: in order to figure out which arg is a backend we call get_backend();
    must either fix this or feel comfortable that instantiating (and not using) a backend
    is side-effect free

2009-06-22  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

    * introduce --name parameter to specify symbolic name of a backup
    * change --archive-dir expansion to look for %DUPLICITY_BACKUP_NAME%
    * which in turn defaults to the args hash previously used for

2009-06-22  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

    * merge from trunk

2009-06-15  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

2009-06-16  Peter Schuller  <peter.schuller@infidyne.com>

    * significantly re-design the asynch scheduler to be much simpler; instead of keeping workers
    and queues, simply launch a thread for each unit of work, blocking when called for by
    a concurrency limit or a barrier. the old design was a result of initially designing for
    keeping a persistent set of workers, only to then drop that idea. when dropping that idea,
    I should have re-done it like this from the start instead of retaining the complexity
    i introduced for the persistent worker design.

    duplicity-only filenames.  Corrected this and removed
    the check for the filename in the first element.

2009-04-07  loafman

    If a file is unreadable due to access rights or other non-
    fatal errors, put out error message and continue.

2009-04-03  loafman

    FTP backend was failing on PureFTPd when the "-x ''"
    option was removed from the second ncftpls popen, a fix
    that was implemented due to bug #24741.  This fix does
    the ls in one pass by extracting either the first or the
    last entry on the 'ls -l'.  [Standard FTP would be nice!]

2009-04-02  loafman

    Changes for 0.5.14.

2009-04-02  loafman

    Normalized include statements and tried to insure that all
    duplicity includes were from the duplicity module.

2009-04-01  loafman

    After email voting among known duplicity contributors,
    the decision was reached to revert to the GPL Version 2
    license, so with their consensus, duplicity is now under
    GPL Version 2.

    The -vN option has not changed.  Verbosity may also be one
    of: character [ewnid], or word ['error', 'warning', 'notice',
    'info', 'debug'].  The default is 4 (Notice).  The options
    -v4, -vn, and -vnotice are functionally equivalent, as are
    the mixed-case versions, -vN, -vNotice, -vNOTICE.

2009-03-29  loafman

    Changed from log.Log with numbered log levels to log.Debug,
    log.Info, log.Notice, log.Warn, log.FatalError as below:
    0  log.FatalError
    1  log.Warn
    2  log.Warn
    3  log.Notice
    4  log.Notice
    5  log.Info
    6  log.Info
    7  log.Info
    8  log.Info
    9 log.Debug
    The -vN option has not changed at this point.

2009-03-29  loafman

    Revert to calling NcFTP utilities (ls, get, put) directly
    rather than scripting ncftp via pexpect.  Move fatal error
    regarding version 3.2.0 to a warning message since it has
    been reported that the segfault problem does not occur on
    most distributions.

2009-03-26  loafman

    Add Changelog.GNU to website and distribution to add a bit of detail
    showing the CVS changes via rcs2log.  Added dist/mkGNUChangelog.sh.

    bug #22908: Don't block gpg-agent
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?22908

    To fix the above, --use-agent was added as a command line option.
    When this is specified and asymetric encryption is enabled, then all
    GnuPG passphrases will come from the gpg-agent or equivalent program
    and no passphrase prompt will be issued.

2009-03-25  loafman

2009-03-19  loafman

2009-03-15  loafman

    GPG errors will no longer cause tracebacks, but will produce a
    log entry, from gpg, similar to the following:
    ===== Begin GnuPG log =====
    gpg: BAD0BAD0: skipped: public key not found
    gpg: [stdin]: encryption failed: public key not found
    ===== End GnuPG log =====
    This will let the user know what really caused the GPG process
    to fail, and what really caused errors like 'broken pipe'.

2007-12-27  loafman

    Added 2nd patch to bug #21475 that forces all versions of
    Python to use the fixed urlparse.py.

    Fixed issue with Pure-FTPd that would always return an empty
    directory listing and thus force a full backup every time.
    A side effect of the change is that we now only make one call
    to ncftpls to get the listing, thereby reducing the overhead
    on systems with a large number of backup files.

    Fix to handling of collections when --archive-dir is used.
    Prior to this, duplicity would write the full sig files to

    Patch from Olivier Croquette to add :port option in FTP.

    Patch from Mitchell Garnaat to get all keys from S3, rather
    than just the first 1000.

    Fix to sshBackend to version check for python-pexpect 2.1.

    Fix one case in ftpBackend where host string was used instead of
    url_string.  This only affected the creation of the target dir on
    the remote system, if it did not exist, and only if the user or
    port needed to be specified.

2007-09-26  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.4.RC2.

2007-09-26  loafman

    Added --timeout <seconds> (default 30) to allow users to change
    duplicity's network timeout settings.

    Added --time-separator <char> to allow users to change the time
    separator from ':' to another character that will work on their
    system.  HINT: For Windows SMB shares, use --time-separator='_'.
    NOTE: '-' is not valid as it conflicts with date separator.

    Changed usage message to separate options and commands.

2007-09-26  loafman

    Add patch from Olivier Croquette to allow user@domain usernames,
    making ftp://user@domain@domain.com/path a valid URL.

    Added a bit of debug print to sshBackend for --verbosity=9.

2007-09-26  loafman

    Add patch from Alexander Zangerl to suppress the GPG passphrase
    prompt when a passphrase is not needed.
    - full and pubkey enc:  doesn't depend on old encrypted info
    - inc and pubkey enc and archive-dir: need manifest and sigs,
    which the archive dir contains unencrypted
    - with encryption disabled
    - listing files:  needs manifest, but the archive dir has that
    - collection status:  only looks at a repository

2007-09-19  loafman

    Final patch for Peter Schuller's fix to max read size.
    The first one was broken (revision previous to this).

2007-09-10  loafman

    Add patch submitted by Peter Schuller which removes the
    default SSH options that ignored known hosts files and
    disabled strict host checking.  This patch also handles
    the authentication failures from these issues.

2007-09-06  loafman

    Fixed so that max read size is 64k, not the
    volume size which can be quite large.

2007-08-20  loafman

    Fix release date.

2007-08-20  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.3 release.

2007-08-20  loafman

    Upgrade to GPL version 3 license.

2007-08-13  loafman

    Do not pass :port part of URL to scp backend.
    Its taken as the target file and errors out.

2007-08-13  loafman

    Change ssh_command option to be ssh_options.  This adds
    options to the scp and sftp commands that are used by
    the ssh backend.

2007-08-13  loafman

    Fixed bug 20764 - unable to use port in ssh backend.
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?20764

    Change ssh backend to send 'quit' instead of EOF when
    using sftp.  This allows it to run under cron as long
    as the password is supplied non-interactively.

2007-08-09  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.3.RC12

2007-08-09  loafman

2007-07-21  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.3.RC11.

2007-07-21  loafman

    Add --ssh-askpass option.

2007-07-21  loafman

    Duplicity now correctly processes scp URL's of the form:
    scp://user@host[:port]/
    where the directory spec is empty.  This fixes a bug where the
    user could not write into the home directory on the target.

    The SSH/SCP backend has had an overhaul.  It now requires the
    python-pexpect module.  Normally this can be obtained from your
    distro's repository, but if you want, you can download pexpect
    from http://pexpect.sourceforge.net.

    The SSH/SCP backend work was done to allow the user to use password
    authentication rather than public-key.  You may now enter a password,
    either through the FTP_PASSWORD environment variable, or at the
    console.  To activate this feature you will need to use the option
    --ssh-askpass on the command line.  The default is public-key, which
    does *not* look for a password from either source.

2007-07-15  loafman

    patch #6094, Boto Backend Fixes for RC10

2007-07-14  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.3.RC10

2007-07-14  loafman

    Add support for:
    --ftp-passive,
    --ftp-regular,
    --num-retries

    Removed -m option on FTP put command.  This means that
    the remote directory must exist prior to backup.

    Changed ftpBackend from -f option back to commandline.
    Various versions of ncftp* interact differently when
    both -f and commandline options are supplied.

    The FTP password is munged in all log operations.

    Added logging of filenames in the bucket when -v9 is
    used on Amazon S3.

2007-07-14  loafman

    Add support for:
    --ftp-passive,
    --ftp-regular,

2007-07-09  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.3.RC9.

2007-07-09  loafman

    Added a commandline option, '--num-retries=<int>', to set the number
    of retries.  The default is 5.

2007-07-09  loafman

    New S3 backend, Boto, from Eric Evans, replaces bitBucket.  Boto can
    be obtained from http://code.google.com/p/boto/.  I did not make this
    a requirement for setup since its not in the normal repositories.

    New FTP backend from Thorsten Schnebeck that uses ncftp instead of
    Pythons ftplib.  This seems to be much more solid.  I added the -f
    option with a secure temp file to contain host, user, and password,
    rather than having them on the command line.  I also added the -m
    option to the put command to create the target directory and the -t
    option to make sure it times out if there is a network problem.

    The Backend class now contains a popen_persist function that acts like
    run_command_persist.  Both use the new num_retries global.

2007-06-29  loafman

    Change to a max block size of 2048 bytes for
    rsync difference buffer.  This may slow things
    down for truly large files, but will give much
    smaller deltas on files with numerous small
    changes, such as database files.

2007-06-28  loafman

    Initial release.

2007-06-27  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.3.RC8

2007-06-27  loafman

    Bug 20039 - Andreas Schildbach: --and--
    Patch 6030 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
    Duplicity now uses bzip2 for compression.  This matches the way
    the Debian distribution handles it.  I'll think about adding an
    option to override later, if its needed.

2007-06-27  loafman

    Bug 20282 - Thomas Tuttle:
    An out of range index when checking past history in the backup
    sets caused a failure when trying to access later.

    Bug 20149 - dAniel hAhler:
    dAniel submitted a second patch for this for further cleanup.
    The new patch prefers the latest intact backup set.

2007-06-19  loafman

    Patch 6029 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
    http://bugs.debian.org/370206
    archive-dir together with incremental backup results in crash. the
    patch is simple, the code in 0.4.2 did attempt to access strings as
    objects.

2007-06-19  loafman

    Patch 6033 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
    let's add a --help terse usage message and don't just direct the user
    to the manual. this should come handy if somebody needs to restore
    stuff without having the manual available.

2007-06-19  loafman

    Patch 6032 - Alexander Zangerl <az@debian.org>:
    a new feature patch: i've recently gotten annoyed with having gazillions of
    5mb files and therefore added a --volsize option to allow the user setting
    the chunk size. the patch is simple and contains a manpage update as well.

2007-06-13  loafman

    flag the error with a message, rather than erroring out.  The user
    then knows to run --cleanup.

2007-06-04  loafman

    Changes for 0.4.3.RC5.

2007-06-04  loafman

    dAniel hAhler submitted a patch to change "Error initializing file

2007-06-04  loafman

    * Update to work with bitbucket 0.3b.
    * Add some docimentation.
    * Implement a suggestion by Ben Escoto to move the access and secret keys to
    environment variables.
    * Implement a very simplistic error correction mechanisim that will re-connect
    on an operation failure and re-try the operation. Note that this is just a
    band-aid for issues that should be resolved at lower levels.
