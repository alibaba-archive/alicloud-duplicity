    Easy-to-use scheduler of function calls to be executed
    concurrently. A very simple dependency mechanism exists in the
    form of barriers (see insert_barrier()).

    Each instance has a concurrency level associated with it. A
    concurrency of 0 implies that all tasks will be executed
    synchronously when scheduled. A concurrency of 1 indicates that a
    task will be executed asynchronously, but never concurrently with
    other tasks. Both 0 and 1 guarantee strict ordering among all
    tasks (i.e., they will be executed in the order scheduled).

    At concurrency levels above 1, the tasks will end up being
    executed in an order undetermined except insofar as is enforced by
    calls to insert_barrier().

    An AsynchScheduler should be created for any independent process;
    the scheduler will assume that if any background job fails (raises
    an exception), it makes further work moot.

        the convenience feature of being able to give parameters to
